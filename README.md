Airbrake - User Attributes
=======================

## Forked

This gem was forked in order to bump the Airbrake dependency version to v5.

## Original Readme

Adds information about the current user to error reports.
This information can only be processed and displayed by
[Errbit, the open source error catcher](https://github.com/errbit/errbit).

This gem can be used as a replacement for the `airbrake` gem,
since it loads `airbrake` as a dependency.
