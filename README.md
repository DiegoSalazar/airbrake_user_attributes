Airbrake - User Attributes
=======================

Adds information about the current user to error reports.
This information can only be processed and displayed by
[Errbit, the open source error catcher](https://github.com/errbit/errbit).

This gem can be used as a replacement for the `airbrake` gem,
since it loads `airbrake` as a dependency.
